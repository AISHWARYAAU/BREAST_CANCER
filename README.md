# Breast cancer diagnosis predictor 
This repository contains a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. Using a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. It provides a visual representation of the input data using a radar chart and displays the predicted diagnosis and probability of being benign or malignant.


The app was developed as a machine learning exercice from the public dataset(Diagnostic) Data Set. This dataset may not be reliable as this project was developed for educational purposes in the field of machine learning only and not for professional use.
