# Breast cancer diagnosis predictor 
This repository contains a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. Using a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. It provides a visual representation of the input data using a radar chart and displays the predicted diagnosis and probability of being benign or malignant.


The app was developed as a machine learning exercice from the public dataset [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://alejandro-ao-streamlit-cancer-predict-appmain-uitjy1.streamlit.app/) (Diagnostic) Data Set. This dataset may not be reliable as this project was developed for educational purposes in the field of machine learning only and not for professional use.
A live version of the application can be found on [Streamlit cloud](https://cancerpredict.streamlit.app/).
